## Installation

## Usage

To use the calender, users can click on each time slot to input text corresponding to planned activities or events occuring within that time. The color for each slot will change depending upon the time the page is loaded. Grey slots are for hours that have already happened. Red slots correspond with the current hour. Green slots are for hours that have not happened yet.
Once the user has input their information, they can click on the button to the right of the text area to save their information. After it has been saved, the information will persist across reloads of the page.
